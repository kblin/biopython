"""Bio.SearchIO parser for BLAST+ output formats.

This module adds support for parsing BLAST+ outputs. BLAST+ is a rewrite
of NCBI's legacy BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), based on the
NCBI C++ toolkit. The BLAST+ suite is available as command line programs
or on NCBI's web page.

Specifically, this module supports the following BLAST+ output formats:

  - XML        - 'blast-xml'
  - Tabular    - 'blast-tab'
  - Plain text - 'blast-text'

And the following BLAST+ programs: blastn, blastp, blastx, tblastn, tblastx

More information are available through these links:

  - Web interface: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
  - User guide: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1762/

For legacy BLAST outputs, see the Bio.Blast module.
